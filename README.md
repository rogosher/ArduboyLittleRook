# ArduboyLittleRook

This is a version of _Little Rook_ that runs on an Arduboy.

## Installation
The [_U8glib_](https://github.com/olikraus/u8glib) library is required to run this game. The _U8glib_ library can added to the Arduino IDE by using the built-in _Library Manager_; it is the same process as adding the _Arduboy_ library to the Arduino IDE. See the [_`U8glib`_ wiki](https://github.com/olikraus/u8glib/wiki) for more information.
